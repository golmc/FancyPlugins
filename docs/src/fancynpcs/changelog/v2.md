- Fixed the skin generation queue gets stuck when an error occurred

## v2.4.3 [!badge variant="info" text="2025-03-11"]

**New skin system**

- You can now use local image files as skin
- Skins set by URL or file can be made slim
- The skin cache system is improved
- A skin generation queue is added
- Skins should load more reliably
- You can set a MineSkin API key to speed up loading skins

When starting the server for the first time, it might take some time (depending on how many npcs with skins you have) to
load all skins.

The API for setting skins also changed. Forget the SkinFetcher, now you only need to do the following:

```java
npc.getData().

setSkin("username / uuid / url / filename");
```

The old SkinFetcher API won't work in this version.

**Other changes**

- Added configurable missing permissions message for the `need_permission` action

  threads)

- Fixed clearing npc equipment via command
- Fixed display name not always visible when npc type is not player (you needed to look at the entity - now it's always
  visible)
- Fixed the `register_commands` not working

**API changes**

- Added NpcLoadedEvent (fired when all NPCs are loaded)

## v2.4.1 [!badge variant="info" text="2024-12-08"]

- Added support for 1.21.4
- Added "need_permission" action - if added the player needs a specific permission, otherwise the action-chain will be
  terminated
- Improved performance of action execution

**API**

Marked current skin system as deprecated.
We're currently working on a new system, which solves rate limiting problems, adds ability to use skins from local files
and adds the ability to specify the skin variant (slim, default). The new skin system will have a slightly new API. If
everything goes right, the new system will be added in the next version. There will be documentation, how to use the new
API then.
